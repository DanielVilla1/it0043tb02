                Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. He is easily excited and can be quite loud, a trait
                second only to Nishinoya and Tanaka. For the most part, Hinata is very simpleminded which sometimes
                causes him to make rash decisions. However, he is also shown to be quite observant. He is capable of
                reading social cues and can be incredibly empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says
                just what others need to hear to push themselves in the right direction. He is also noted to be a
                natural schmoozer, a quality that his teammates occasionally use to win someone over such as when
                Nishinoya agreed to help with Hinata's receives after being flattered by the first-year. His friendly
                and straightforward personality allows him to befriend even the quietest of people effortlessly, such as
                Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.

                Perpetually sullen, arrogant, and undeniably short-tempered, Kageyama originally came off as a typical
                overbearing perfectionist, caring only about winning and completely disregarding the opinions and
                well-being of his teammates. His habit of complaining about their performance and barking orders at them
                eventually led the other players in Kitagawa Daiichi to nickname him the "King of the Court," a constant
                reminder of the oppressive, egocentric attitude he demonstrated during his volleyball career in junior
                high.

                Despite his flirtatious nature (which makes him famous amongst female students, much to Tanaka and
                Nishinoya's envy) and childishness, Oikawa is an excellent, well-rounded player and is extremely serious
                about volleyball. He's known to have a "disgusting personality" amongst both opponents and his own
                teammates because of his smug and outwardly flippant attitude. Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful
                remarks but follows up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. He is extremely intelligent and
                cunning and easily figures out both his teammates' and opponents' weaknesses.

                Kuroo has a laid-back yet scheming personality and is considered a "provocation expert" by many. He
                would actively provoke others and is unrelenting when dishing out snide remarks. This is demonstrated in
                the way he angers Tsukishima when the first-year blocker maintained a nonchalant attitude toward
                volleyball during the summer training camp. However, Kuroo is kinder and more genuine than what his
                exterior image conveys. After realizing he has overstepped a line, Kuroo seeks out and apologizes to
                Daichi about the provocation. Later on, proving that while he is a "provocation expert," sportsmanship
                is still important to him.[2] He also cares and respects his elder coach, Yasufumi Nekomata, immensely,
                enough to help Karasuno improve to fulfill Nekomata's dream of competing against each other at
                nationals.

                Since childhood, Hoshiumi has been on the shorter side. He has light-colored hair that he had kept very
                short early on and large, wide eyes similar to that of a seagull. He had let his hair grow some time
                after he met Hirugami and has it styled similar to the plumage of a bird. Being so athletic, Hoshiumi
                has gained a strong figure.
                <br><br>
                Sometime after his second year of high school, Hoshiumi cut his hair and reverted back to the hairstyle
                he had when he was young. He has also gotten slightly taller since high school.
